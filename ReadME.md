# Welcome
This Repo was created to catalog and track all code files and projects for Quantum Networking, Spring 2025 at SUNY Polytechnic Institute

## Author: Matthew Townsend, Graduate Student
**' The readme is ordered in class progression '**

## Pennylane/class-2
* Consisting of basic array and circuit creation and manipulation
* The latter two files include manipulation of circuit design, which included some basic code referenced in Quiz01 which was to line the wires in the correct order.
## Grover
* This algorithm took our class a while to work through. I supplied a Pennylane implementation and was forced to present it by Professor Chen.

## Coin Walker 
* The discrete Quantum Walk, which provides some basis for algorithms in the quantum state, is useful for the progress in advanced algorithms
* Hiperwalk - we ran out of time and only briefly mentioned it. 

## QFT - Quantum Fourier Transformation
* The Quantum Fourier Transformation was the topic I chose for the final
* I found it interesting as the bulk of this transformation is identical to its classical counterpart, and it can encode binary values to states, transform, and pull them back out. I will not attempt to write the equation in Markdown.
