# Welcome
This Repo was created to catalog and track all code filkes and projects for Quantum Networking, Sping 2025 at SUNY Polytechnic Institute

**' The readme is ordered in class progression '**

## Pennylane/class-2
* Consisting of basic array and circuit creation and manipulation
* latter two files include manipulation of circuit design which included some bases code which was referenced in Quiz01 whcih was to line the wires in the correct order.
## Grover
* This algorithm took our class a while to work through, I supplied a pennylane implementation and was forced to present it by Professor Chen.

## Coin Walker 
* The discrete Quantum Walk, which provides some basis for algorithms in the quantum state, is useful for the progress in advanced algorithms
* Hiperwalk - we ran out of time and only breifly mentioned. 

## QFT
* The Quantum Fourier Tranformation was the topic I choose for the final
* I found it interesting as the bulk of this transformation is identical to its classical counterpart, and its able to encode binary values to states, transform and pull them back out.
